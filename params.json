  "body": "### Brief Introduction\r\nThis application was created during my Thesis project for my bachelor degree. The idea was to create an Android application which could record the raw data given by different sensors. Further this data can be analysed for various purposes.\r\n\r\n### Sensors\r\nWe've used support for recording data from following sensors:\r\n1. GPS\r\n2. Accelerometer\r\n3. Magnetometer\r\n4. Gyroscope\r\nAll these sensors can be activated/listened to by simply changing a few lines in the code. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThis app contains a lot of useful features which are very essential for the developers. Auto start/stop recording, High Speed data recording in file, and upload to server to name a few.\r\n\r\n#### Auto stop-start recording\r\nThe greatest feature that we designed was to start and stop the recording based on the movement. Movement was detected by pinging GPS after some amount of time which was configurable through settings.\r\n \r\n#### Upload to server. \r\nYou can upload your recorded data to server provided there is a script handling the file upload. At the time of designing this application, we used a PHP server. The IP-Address of the server is also configurable through settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI along with my two other teammates developed this application. Prikshit Kumar (@prikshit), Pankaj Kumar (@bumblebee6493) and Parmeet Singh (@ParmeetSingh)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the code or struck at something?
