<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This application was created during our Thesis project for our bachelor degree. The idea was to create an Android application which could record the raw data given by different sensors. This data can be further analysed for various purposes. In our case, it was to detect potholes on roads.</p>

<h2>
<a id="sensors" class="anchor" href="#sensors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sensors</h2>

<p>We've used support for recording data from following sensors:</p>

<ul>
<li>GPS</li>
<li>Accelerometer</li>
<li>Magnetometer</li>
<li>Gyroscope
All these sensors can be listened to by simply changing a few lines in the code. </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<p>This app contains a lot of useful features which are very essential for the developers. Auto start/stop recording, High Speed data recording in file, and upload to server to name a few.</p>

<h3>
<a id="auto-stop-start-recording" class="anchor" href="#auto-stop-start-recording" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Auto stop-start recording</h3>

<p>The greatest feature that we designed was to start and stop the recording based on the movement. Movement was detected by pinging GPS after some amount of time which was configurable through settings.</p>

<h3>
<a id="upload-to-server" class="anchor" href="#upload-to-server" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upload to server.</h3>

<p>You can upload your recorded data to server provided there is a script handling the file upload. At the time of designing this application, we used a PHP server. The IP-Address of the server is also configurable through settings.</p>

<h3>
<a id="high-speed-file-writing" class="anchor" href="#high-speed-file-writing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>High speed File Writing</h3>

<p>This application records data in a file on the Android filesystem. File is write-ahead only. It was designed in a such a way that it shouldn't consume too much memory and still be able to append data at a very fast rate. (500 writes per second on average) </p>
